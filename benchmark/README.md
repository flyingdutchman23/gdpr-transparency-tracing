# Benchmark

We want to compare 3 different states:
1. The current state on master, meaning our developed application
2. Our application without Jaeger at all
3. Our application with Jaeger but with the Transparency Tags

## Procedure

## Case 1
Perform benchmark for case 1 by doing this:
```
git checkout master
make aws
```
